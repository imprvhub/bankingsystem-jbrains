Welcome to the **Simple Banking System** repository!

## Project Overview

In the age of digitalization, understanding how the banking system works is crucial. This project aims to provide an opportunity to delve into the world of banking systems, SQL databases, and programming concepts. By exploring the Luhn algorithm, you'll learn how it can enhance data accuracy when dealing with card numbers. Additionally, this project introduces fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts through the utilization of classes.

With the proliferation of credit cards, managing money has become more convenient than ever. Credit cards not only save time and effort but also offer consumer protection. This project focuses on creating a straightforward banking system that incorporates the power of databases to manage transactions and account information.

## Project Features

- Gain insights into how a basic banking system functions.
- Understand the role of SQL databases in financial applications.
- Explore the Luhn algorithm and its importance in preventing errors during card number entry.
- Get acquainted with fundamental OOP concepts, including classes and inheritance.
